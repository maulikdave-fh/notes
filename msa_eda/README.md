# Introduction
## Microservices architecture
The system is organized as a collection of independent services. Each scope has its narrow scope of responsibility and is fully owned by a small team of developers (2 Pizza Rule).

When done correctly;
- allows organizations to scale
- allows system to scale
- keep organizations cost low - lesser on-boarding cost, lesser coordination among teams, productive teams - smaller codebase -> quicker to load in IDE > quicker to test & deploy, smaller deployables -> can run on commodity hardware
- stay efficient and innovative

## Event Driven Architecture
Commonly used with microservices architecture.

By established asynchronous event based communication between microservices,  we can achieve even greater;
- decoupling
- higher scalability

EDA allows to implement very powerful design patterns for microservices architecture.

## Challenges of Monolithic Application
Typically, 3-tier web-based application looks like following. The app is deployed as a single process, hence called a monolithic.
