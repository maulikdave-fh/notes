# About Agile
Agile Manifesto (4 items) -> 12 Principles of Agile Software -> Multiple Methods (Scrum / Kanban / Scrumban / XP / Lean Development / SAFe / and many more)

In brief, Agile is about putting the customer business needs first, eliminating wasteful processes and promoting in-person interactions among team-members and with customer representative.

# Agile Manifesto values
1. <b>Individuals and interactions</b> over processes and tools
2. <b>Working Software</b> over comprehensive documentation
3. <b>Customer collaboration</b> over negotiating contracts
4. <b>Responding to change</b> over following a plan

12. Retrospectives for continous improvements

# Inverting the Triangle
In Traditional project mgmt, Scope is fixed, Time and Cost vary. In Agile, Time and Cost are fixed, scope vary. With time and cost fixed, Agile forces you to focus on delivering the most valuable features to your customers. 

# Agile Methods
## Scrum (Means Meeting)
1. Product Owner - Designated person that represents the customer on the project. Defines & prioritizes the features
2. Scrum Master - Facilitates the process
3. Product Backlog - Project requirements from the stakeholders
4. Sprint Planning meeting - Meeting done by the agile team to determine what features will be done in the next sprint
5. Sprint Backlog - Work the team selects to get done in the next sprint
6. Sprint - Short iteration where the project team work to complete the work in the sprint backlog (1-4 weeks typically)
7. Daily Stand-up - A quick meeting each day to discuss project status. (15 mins., usually)
8. Sprint Review - An inspection done at the end of the sprint by the customer
9. Retrospective - Meeting done to determine what went wrong during the sprint and what went right.
10. Release - Several sprints worth of work directed to operations for possible rollout

## eXtreme Programming (XP)
1. <b>Core Values</b> Simplicity, Commuication, Feedback, Courage (Transparency), Respect
2. <b>Roles</b> Coach, Customer, Programmers, Testers
3. <b>Practices</b> Planning Activities - Release Planning, Iteration Planning, Small Releases, Collective Code Ownership, Coding Standards, Sustainable Pace, Continuous Integraion, TDD, Pair Programming, Simple Design, Refactoring
4. Scrum and XP are not too different

## Lean Development
1. <b>Principles</b> Using visual management tools, Identify customer-defined values, Learning and continuous Improvements
2. Elimate Waste (partially done work, delays, handoffs, unnecessary features, extra processes, defects, task switchings), Empower Team, Deliver Fast, Optimize the Whole, Build Quality in, Defer Decisions, Amplify Learning

## Kanban (JP word for Signboard)
1. Derived from Lean Development
2. Kanban Board - Low-tech, High-touch system - white board, sticky notes
3. Limit WIP - the team decides max. WIP
4. <b>Core Principles</b>Visualize the Workflow - Information radiators, Limit WIP - improves visibility of issues and bottlenecks, Manage Flow, Make process policies explicit, Improve collaboration

## FDD (Feature Driven Development)

## Scalable Agile Framework (SAFe)
1. Scrum at enterprise level
2. For large global teams

# Agile Tools & Techniques
## Prioritization Techniques
Features are prioritized based on business value, risk and dependencies
### Simple Scheme
1. Priority 1, Priority 2, Priority 2, etc
2. Could be problematic as many items might become the first priority
### MoSCoW 
1. Must Have
2. Should Have
3. Could Have
4. Would like to have, but not this time
### Dot Voting or Multi-Voting / Monopoly Money
1. Each person gets a certain number of dots / money to distribute to the requirements that they value the most

## Deliver Value Incrementally

## Minimal Viable Product
A set of functionality that is complete to be useful, but small enough not to be an entire project - Quicker go to market -> Early feedback

## Value Decomposition
One of the techinques - Design the product box

## Definition of Done
Shared understanding of what it means when work is considered done, it should be defined at the beginning of the project. Examples; DoD for Unit & functional tests, DoD for development, DoD for a story

# Information Radiators 
## Burndown Chart
A graphical representation of work left to do versus time. The outstanding work (or backlog) is often on the vertical axis, with time along the horizontal. A burndown chart is a run chart of remaining work. It is useful for predicting when all of the work will be completed. 

Remaining work can be represented in terms of either time or story points (a sort of arbitrary unit). Use burndown chart at sprint level, not at project level as project will have more features coming in or not all features may be estimated up-front.

## Velocity
To help teams estimate how much work they can complete in a given time period based on how quickly similar work was previously completed. Velocity is relative measure. In other words, the raw numbers mean little; it is the trend that matters.

Important for sustainable development and consistency. At least 3 sprints should be completed to get a reliable velocity.

## Flow Metrics
### WIP board
Is a visual tool, often a Kanban board, used to track and manage tasks or projects that are currently in progress, helping teams visualize workflow, limit work-in-progress, and improve efficiency. 

### Cycle Time
Cycle time is the time it takes for a work item to move through the entire development process, from initiation to completion, including all stages like planning, coding, testing, and deployment, helping teams understand their efficiency and identify areas for improvement. It is a lagging indicator.

### Throughput
Measures the number of completed work items (e.g., user stories, tasks) delivered within a specific period, regardless of size or complexity, helping teams assess their capacity and efficiency.

While velocity focuses on the amount of work completed in story points, throughput focuses on the number of items completed, regardless of size or complexity.

### Work Item Age
Elasped time between when a work item "started" and the current time. It is a leading indicator - relevant for non-finished items.

## Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD)
1. Provides insights into flow management- Number of Features / Tasks / Issues / Stories -> Timeline
2. Helps measure Lead Time, Cycle Time, WIP (Work In Progress), Throughput
3. Preferred - Consistent Band thickness
4. Narrowing Bands - Possibly, teams have more capacity
5. Broadening Bands - Higher WIP. May be because of dependencies.
6. Flat curve - Possible blocker / bottleneck

# Important Terms & Concepts
## Project
A temporary endeavor that produces a unique product, service, or result. Has definite beginning and ending. Can be part of a large program / portfolio. Projects enable changes.

## Project Management
Application of knowledge, tools, skills, and techniques to satisfy project requirements. 

## Program Management
Group of related projects managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and control not available from managing them individually

## Portfolio Management
A collection of projects, programs, subsidiary portfolios, and operations managed as a group to achieve strategic (long term) objectives.

## Stakeholders
Individuals, group, or organization that may affect, be affected, or perceive to be affected by the project. Examples; Customer, Project Team, Project Sponsor.

## Areas of a Project
Scope, Schedule, Cost, Quality (Customer Satisfaction), Resources, Commmunications (Stakeholders get correct information at the right time), Risk (Identifying and and responding to the risks over project lifecycle), Procurements, Stakeholders' Engagement (Keeping all stakeholders active and alert on the project)

## Project vs. Project Management
Product Mgmt encompasses the strategic planning, developement, and lifecycle management of a product or a service. It involves understanding market needs, defining product strategy, gathering requirements, and overseeing the product's development, launch and ongoing optimization. Product Managers are responsible for overall success of the product, aligning it with business objectives and customer demands.

Project Mgmt falls into a lifecycle of product management. 

## Risk vs Issues vs Assumptions vs Constraints
<b>Risks</b> are potential events or situations that may occur in the future and have an impact on the project's success<br>
<b>Issues</b> refer to problems and challenges that arise during the course of a project. They are typically negative events and circumstances that can hinder progress or impact project objectives<br>
<b>Assumptions</b> are statments or beliefs that are considered to be true or valid for the purpose of planning and decision-making<br>
<b>Constraints</b> are limitations or restrictions that affect project planning and execution<br>

## Incremental vs. Iterative 
<b>Iterative development</b> is an approach where you build entire product as a whole and based on the feedback, make changes and release it again as a whole. You follow this cycle until customer is satisfied with the product.<br>
<b>Increment development</b> is an approach where you build and deliver product features in increments. 
<table>
  <tr><th>Approach</th><th>Requirements</th><th>Activities</th><th>Delivery</th><th>Goal</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Predictive (Waterfall)</td><td>Fixed</td><td>Performed once for the entire project</td><td>Single Delivery</td><td>Manage Cost</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Iterative</td><td>Dynamic</td><td>Repeated until correct</td><td>Single Delivery</td><td>Correctness of solution</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Incremental (Scrum)</td><td>Dynamic</td><td>Performed once for a given increment</td><td>Frequent Smaller Deliveries</td><td>Speed</td></tr>

<br>Agile leverages Iterative and Incremental, both. Choose what is best for the project.
